 You have k lists of sorted integers in ascending order. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists.

 We define the range [a,b] is smaller than range [c,d] if b-a < d-c or a < c if b-a == d-c.

 Example 1:
 Input:[[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]
 Output: [20,24]
 Explanation:
 List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].
 List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].
